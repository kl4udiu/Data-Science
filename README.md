__PLEASE READ ! If you get a "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing the Notebooks, please do the following:__
1. Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
2. Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/kl4udiu/Data-Science/blob/main/Austin%20Dogs.ipynb") there and then you get "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kl4udiu/Data-Science/blob/main/Austin%20Dogs.ipynb"

## You can find here my personal projects where I will be practicing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python.

My first ever project is an Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on a dataset found on Kaggle.com, data representing the Intakes from an Animal Shelter in Austin Texas USA. Can be found [here](https://github.com/kl4udiu/Data-Science/blob/main/Austin%20Dogs.ipynb)

In this small project I just wanted to practice a bit of data cleanup and visualisation on a dataset found on Kaggle.com . It is a small dataset based on a Survey on Food Preference and can be found [here](https://github.com/kl4udiu/Data-Science/blob/main/Food%20Preference%20Survey.ipynb)

My first attempt at training a model to predict a price. The dataset was one on Avocado prices. The Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/kl4udiu/Data-Science/blob/main/Avocado%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb) and there you can find a bit of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), data preparation and training a simple Linear Regression model.
